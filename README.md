# fragrance_dataset

Two datasets I recorded in the past months. 
* samples.csv
* orders.csv

|metric|explanation|
|---|---|
|s_cost|sample cost|
|s_ml|sample ml|
|s_amount|sample amount|
|s_rating|sample rating|
|fb_cost|full bottle cost|
|fb_ml|full bottle ml|

The reasons for the NAs in the sample rating column are because I either have  a faint memory of them or they are too new and I haven't decided yet.
